# Covenant Check
'Covenant Check' is a World of Warcraft addon designed to help us check WQ for Necrolord Unity and easier to copy/paste into Discord chat, rather than repetitive typing every day :)  Also for Revendreth, Venthyr, it checks for Mirror (checking Pet Battle) then adds Waypoint to 3 different mirror locations.

There is nothing for Night Fae.  I'm not sure about Kyrian since I do not have a character in that Covenant yet...
